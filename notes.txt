AUTHENTICATION

1. create a model user.js.
2. create user.js in routes for routes handling authentication.
3. Create controller -> user.js , for handling the function inside the routes.
4. complete the user.js in routes and call it from index.js file.
5. Create a new route in staticrouters for rendering a sign up page.
6. create an html signup page with forms.



In this application we will use stateless authentication with the help of jwt tokens.
